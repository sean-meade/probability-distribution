    "\n",
    "* A sum of 2 is almost 2 standard deviations below the expected value. \n",
    "* A sum of 11 or 12 is over standard deviations above the expected value. \n",

    "* The distribution of 1d6 is uniform. Each outcome is equally likely.\n",
    "* The distribution of 2d6 dice sums is not uniform (unequal probability of outcomes) or normal (it's more triangular), the concept gives us an intuitive sense of rarity: the farther an event is from the expected value in terms of standard deviations, the rarer it might be. (demonstrated in the plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial calculation confirmed this intuition, showing that the combined probability of getting a sum less than 3 or greater than 10 is only 11.11%, making it a relatively infrequent occurrence when rolling two dice."

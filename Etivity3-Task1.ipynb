    "* Philip Clarke also gave me a clue that I gone massively off-track on my initial draft. Thank you! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Trials:** The number of trials has a big impact on the visualisations. If you do too few trials, you will not get a good idea of the distribution. We showed this above. The larger the number of trials, the more you wil tends towards the ideal $E[X]$ and $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability of Specific Outcomes:** The initial question asked for the probability that the sum of the two dice rolls is less than 3 or more than 10. I have shown that this probability is $\\approx 11.11$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Value:** \n",
    "We determined that the average sum of two dice rolls is 7. This means that, over a large number of rolls, we would expect the average sum to be close to 7 (demonstrated in the plots).\n",

    "**Standard Deviation:** We found the standard deviation to be approximately 2.4152. This quantifies the average deviation of the sums from the expected value of 7. It provides insight into just how spread out the possible sums are.\n",

    "To put it in perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A sum of 2 is almost 2 standard deviations below the expected value. \n",
    "* A sum of 11 or 12 is over standard deviations above the expected value. \n",

    "* The distribution of 1d6 is uniform. Each outcome is equally likely.\n",
    "* The distribution of 2d6 dice sums is not uniform (unequal probability of outcomes) or normal (it's more triangular), the concept gives us an intuitive sense of rarity: the farther an event is from the expected value in terms of standard deviations, the rarer it might be. (demonstrated in the plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial calculation confirmed this intuition, showing that the combined probability of getting a sum less than 3 or greater than 10 is only 11.11%, making it a relatively infrequent occurrence when rolling two dice."
